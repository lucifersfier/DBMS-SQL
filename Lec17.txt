***********************  THE MASTER SLAVE DATABASE CONCEPT ****************************

1) - It is a general way to optimise IO in a system where number if requests goes way high that a single DB server is not able to handle it efficiently.

2) - The true or latest data is kept in the Master DB thus write operations are directed there. Reading operations are done only from slaves.
     This architecture serves the purpose of safeguarding  site eliability, availabiltiy, reduce latency etc. If a site receives a lot of traffic and 
     the only available databse is one master, it will be overloaded with reading and writing requests. Making the entire system slow for everyone on the site.

3) - DB replication will take care of distributing data from master machine to slave machines. this can be Synchronous and Asynchronous depending upon the 
     system's needs.
