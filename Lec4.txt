#################### EXTENDED ER FEATURES #############################

1) - SPECIALISATION ----->>>>>

    (a) - It is splitting up the entity set into further sub entity sets on the basis of their functionalities, 
          specialities and features.
    (b) - It is a Top-Down approach.
    (c) - Example - Person(Superclass) entity set can be divided into (subclasses) -> customer, student and employee
    (d) - Why specialisation ?
          (i) - Certain attributes may only be applicable to a few entities of the parent entity set.
          (ii) - Database designer can show the distinctive features of the sub entities.
          (iii) - To group such entities we apply Specialisation, to overall refine the DB blueprint.

2) - GENERALISATION ----->>>>>

    (a) - It is just a reverse of Specialisation.
    (b) - " is-a" relationship is present between subclass and Superclass.
    (c) - It is a Bottom-up approach.
    (d) - Why GENERALISATION ?
          (i) - Makes DB more refine and Simpler.
          (ii) - Common attributes are not repeated.

3) - ATTRIBUTE INHERITANCE ----->>>>>

    (a) - Both specialisation and generalisation, has attribute inheritance.
    (b) - Example - customer and employee inherit the attributes.

4) - PARTICIPATION INHERITANCE ----->>>>>

    (a) - If a parent entitity set participates in a relationship then it's child entitity sets will also participate 
          in that relationship.

5) - AGGREGATION ----->>>>>

    (a) - It's the technique to show relationships among relationships.
    (b) - ABSTRACTION is applied to treat relationships as higher level entities. We can call it Abstract entity
    (c) - Avoid Redundancy by aggregating relationship as an entity set itself.
