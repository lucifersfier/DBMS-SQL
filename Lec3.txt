#######################    ER Model   ########################

1) - Data Model - collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and consistency
                  constraints.

2) - ER MODEL - It is a high level data model based on a perception of a real world that consists of a collection 
                of basic objects, called entities and relationships among these objects.

3) - ENTITY -  An entity is a "thing" or "object" in the real world.
               (a) - It has Physical existence.
               (b) - Entity can be uniquely identified.
               (c) - There are two types of entity - (i) - Strong (ii) - Weak

4) - ENTITY SET - It is a set of entities of the same type that that share the same properties, or attributes.
                  example: Student and Customer of the bank

5) - ATTRIBUTES - An entity is represented by a set of attributes.
                  Each entity has a value for each of its attributes.
                  For each attribute, there is a set of permitted values, called the domain.

6) - TYPES OF ATTRIBUTES - 
                  (a) - Simple
                  (b) - Composite
                  (c) - Single valued
                  (d) - Multi-valued
                  (e) - Derived 
                  (f) - Null

7) - Realtionships - 

                   (a) - association among two or more entities.
                   (b) - Strong relationship between two independent entities.
                   (c) - Weak relationship, between weak entity and its stron entity.

8) - Degree of Realtionship - 

                   (a) - Number of entities participating in a relationship.
                   (b) - Unary, Binary & Ternary are three types of relationships.

9) - Realtionship Constraints - 

                   (a) - One to one : Citizen has Adhar Card.
                   (b) - One to many : Citizen has vehicle. 
                   (c) - Many to one : Course taken by professor.
                   (d) - Many to Many : Customer buys product.

10) - Paricipation Constraints - 

                   (a) - Minimum cardinality constraints
                   (b) - Weak entity has total participation constraint, but Strong may not have total.
