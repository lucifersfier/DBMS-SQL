        (b) - They are highly optimised for working with Structured Data.
        (c) - They use a well known querying language through SQL.
        (d) - Scalability issues(Horizontal Scaling).
        (e) - Data become huge System become more complex.

                (a) - Data storage and retrieval is easy and quick.
                (b) - Relatively friendly to Model the advance real world problems.
        
        Disadvantages -->>

                (a) - High complexity causes performance issues.
                (b) - Doesn't support views like Relational Databases.
                (c) - Example - ObjectDB, GemStone etc.
