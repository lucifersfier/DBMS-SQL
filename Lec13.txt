            **********************************      Types Of Database     **********************************

1) - RELATIONAL DATABASES ---->>>>

        (a) - They are based on Relational Model.
        (b) - They are highly optimised for working with Structured Data.
        (c) - They use a well known querying language through SQL.
        (d) - Scalability issues(Horizontal Scaling).
        (e) - Data become huge System become more complex.

2) - Object Oriented Database ---->>>>

        (a) - They are based on the Object Oriented Programming paradigmn.
        (b) - In object Oriented Databases data is treated as an object.
        (c) - All bits of information come in one instantly available object package instead of multiple tables.
        

        ADVANTAGES -->>

                (a) - Data storage and retrieval is easy and quick.
                (b) - Relatively friendly to Model the advance real world problems.
        
        Disadvantages -->>

                (a) - High complexity causes performance issues.
                (b) - Doesn't support views like Relational Databases.
                (c) - Example - ObjectDB, GemStone etc.

3) - HIERARCHICAL DATABASES -->>

        (a) - As the name suggests, the hierarchical database model is most appropriate for use cases in which the main focus of
              information gathering is based on a concrete hierarchy, such as several individual employees reporting to a single department at 
              a company.
        (b) - The Schema for hierarchical databases is defined by its tree-like organisation.
        (c) - The disk storage system is also inherently a hierarchical structure, these models can also be used as physical modes.
        (d) - the major diadvantages of hierarchical databses as their inflexible nature.
              the one to many structures isn't ideal for complex structures as it can't describe relationships in which each child node has
              multiple parents nodes. Also the tree like organisation of data requires top to bottom sequential searching, which is time consuming,
              and requires repeatitive storage data in multiple different entities, which can be redundant.
        (e) - Example - IBM, IMS

4) - Network Databases -->>

        (a) - Extension of hierarchical databases.
        (b) - Organised in Graph structure 
        (c) - M:N links may cause slow retrievals 
        (d) - Example - Integrated data store (IDS), IDMS (Integrated Database Management System) etc.
