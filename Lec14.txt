*********************************       CLUSTERING IN DBMS      *********************************

1) - Database Clustering is the process of combining more than one servers or instances connecting a single databse.
2) - Replicate the same datasets on different servers.

3) - ADVANTAGESS -->>

        (a) - Data Redundancy -->

                                The Redundancy that clustering offers is requires and is quite certain due to the synchronisation. In case 
                                any of the servers had to face a failure due to any possible reason, the data is available at other servers 
                                to access.

        (b) - Load Balancing -->

                                Scalability doesn't come by default with the database. Basically, what load balancing does is allocating the workload
                                among the different servers that are part of the cluster. This indicates that more users can be supported and if for some 
                                reasons if a huge spike in the traffic appears, there is a higher assurance that it will be able to support the new traffic.
                                One machine is not going to get all of the hits. This can  provide scaling seamlessly as required. This links directly to 
                                high availability.

        (c) - High Availability -->

                                When you access a database, it implies that is available. High availability refers the amount of time a database 
                                is considered available. 

4) - How does Clustering Work ?

        In cluster architecture, all requests are split with many computers so that an individual user request is executed and produced by a number of
        computer system. the clustering is serviceable definitely by the ability of load balancing and high availability. If one node collapses, the request is
        handled by another node. Consequently, there are few or no possibilities of absolute system failures.
