########################        INDEXING IN DBMS        #############################

1) - Indexing is used to optimise the performance of a database by minimising the number of disk accesses
     required when a query is processed.

2) - The index is a type of data structure. it is used to locate and access the data in a database table
     quickly.

3) - Indexing is optional, but increases access speed. It is not the primary mean to access the tuple, it 
     is the secondary mean.

4) - Index file is always sorted.

5) - Indexing Methods -->>
                         (1) - Primary Index(Clustering Index) - A file may have several indices, on different 
                                                                 search keys. 
                                                                 A primary index is an index whose search key also
                                                                 defines the sequential order of the file.
                         (a) - Dense and Sparse indices - The Dense Index contains an index record for every search
                                                          key value in the data file.
                                                          Sparse Index helps you to resolve the issues of dense
                                                          indexing in DBMS. A range of index columns stores the same
                                                          data block address, and when data needs to be retrieved,
                                                          the block address will be fetched.

                         (b) - Based on Key attribute - Data file is sorted w.r.t primary key attribute.
                                                        Primary key will be used as search-key in index.
                                                        Sparse index will be formed i.e, no. of entries in the index file 
                                                        is equal to  no. of blocks in datafile.

                         (c) - Based on Non-Key attribute - Data file is sorted w.r.t non-key attribute.
                                                            No. of entries in the index = unique non-key attribute value in the data
                                                            file.
                                                            This is dense index as, all the unique valus have an entry in the index file.
                         (d) - Multi-Level Index - Index with two or more levels.
                                                   If the single level index become enough large that the binary search 
                                                   it self we can break down indexing into multiple levels.

                         (2) - Secondary Index(Non-Clustering index) - Data file in unsorted. Hence, Primary indexing
                                                                       isn't possible.
                                                                       It can be done on key or non-key attribute.           
                                                                       It is called secondary indexing because normally one 
                                                                       indexing is already done.
                                                                       It's an example of Dense index

6) - Advantages of Indexing -->>

          (a) - faster access and retrieval of data.
          (b) - IO is less

7) - limitations of Indexing -->>

          (a) - Additional space to store index table.
          (b) - Indexing decrease performance in INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE query.
