*******************************     RELATIONAL MODEL        *******************************

1) - 2 steps to design Database

        (a) - ER Model -->> ER Diagram
        (b) - Relational Model

2) - Relational Model organises the data in the form of relations(tables).

3) - A row in a table represents a relationships among a set of values, and table is collection of such relationships.

4) - Tuple defines the record of the table and the column defines the attributes of the table.

5) - Relation Schema defines the design and structure of the relation, contains the name of the relation and all
     the attributes.

6) - Number of attributes in a relation is known as Degree of table.
7) - Total number of tuple in a relation is known as Cardinality.

8) - Relational Key : -->>  Set of attributes which can uniquely identify an each tuple.

9) - Relational Model keys ---->>>>

        (a) - Super Key: Any P&C attributes present in a table which can uniquely identify each tuple.
        (b) - Candidate Key: Minimal subset of super keys.
        (c) - Primary Key: Selected from the candidate key and has the least number of Attributes
        (d) - Alternate Key: All except Primary key
        (e) - Foreign Key: 

                (i) - it creates relation between two tables.
                (ii) - It helps to cross reference between two different relations.
        
        (f) - Composite Key: Primary key formed using atleast two attributes.
        (g) - Compound Key: Primary Key which is formed using two foriegn key.
        (h) - Surrogate Key: 

                (i) - Synthetic Primary Key
                (ii) - Generated automatically by DB, usually an integer value.
                (iii) - maybe used as Primary key.

10) - Integrity Constraints 

        (i) - CRUD operations must be done with some integrity policy so that DB is always consistent.
        (ii) - Introduced so that we do not accidently corrupt the DB.
        (iii) - Domain Constraints ---->>>>
                (a) - Restricts the Value in the attribute of a relation, specifies the relation.
                (b) - Restricts the data types of every attributes.
        (iv) - Entity Constraints ---->>>>
                (a) - Every relation should have Primary key
                (b) - Primary Key Can't be Null
        (v) - Referential Constraints ---->>>>>
                (a) - Insert Constraint - value can't be inserted in child table if the value isn't lying in the 
                                          parent table.
                (b) - Delete Constraint - Value can't be deleted from the parent table if the value is lying in the
                                          child table

11) ON DELETE CASCADE -->>

                        Ques -  can we delete value from parent table if the value is lying in the child table without 
                          violating the delete constraints ?

                        Ans - Yes 
                              Delete value from parent table -->> delete corresponding entry from child table too.
                              create table order(order_id,int PK,____,____,cust_id,int referencing customer on delete cascade)

                        Ques - can foriegn key have Null Values ? (On Delete NULL)

                        Ans - Yes on delete value from parent table -->> put corresponding foreign key value Null.

12) - Key Constraints -->>

        (a) - NOT NULL
        (b) - UNIQUE
        (c) - DEFAULT
        (d) - CHECK
        (e) - PRIMARY Key
        (f) - FOREIGN key
