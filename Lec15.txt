*****************************  DATABASE OPTIMISATION  ***************************

A big problem can be solved easily when it is chopped into several smaller sub-problems. That is what the partitioning technique does.
It divides a big database containing data metrics and indexes into smaller and handy slices of data called partitions.
Once the databse is partitioned, the data definition language can easily work on the smaller partitioned slices, instead of handling the giant database
together. This is how partitioning cuts down the problems in managing large database tables.
