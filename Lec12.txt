********************************** NoSql vs SQL DB **********************************

1) - NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. 
     NoSQL databases are likely document, key-value, wide-column and graph.
     They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

     (a) - They are schema free 
     (b) - Data structure used aren't tabular, they are more flexible, has the ability to adjust dynamically.
     (c) - Most of the NoSQL are open sources and has the capability of horizontal scaling.
     (d) - It just stores data in some other format other than relational. 

2) - NoSQL databases allow developers to store huge amounts of unstructured data, giving them a lot of flexibility.

3) - some NoSQL databases like MongoDB provide these capabilities.

4) - NoSQL DB Advantages --->>

        (a) - Flexible schema : RDBMS has pre-defined schema, which become an issue when we 
                                don't have all the data with us or we need to change the schema.

        (b) - Horizontal scaling : 
                                   (a) - It is also known as Scale-out, refers to bringing on additional nodes
                                         to share the load. This is difficult with relational databases
                                         due to the difficulty in spreading out related data across nodes.
                                         With non-relational databases, this is made simpler since collections are 
                                         self-contained and not coupled relationally. This allows them to be distributed 
                                         across nodes more simply, as queries do not have to "join" them together across nodes.
                                   (b) - It is achieved through Sharding or Replica-Sets.

        (c) - High Availability :  
                                   (a) - NoSQL databases are highly available due to its auto replication feature i.e., whenever
                                         any kind of failure 
                                         happens data replicates itself to the preceding consistent state.
                                   (b) - if a server fails, we can access that data from another server as well, as in NoSQL
                                         database data is store at multiple servers.

        (d) - Easy Insert and Read Operations : 

                                   (a) - Queries in NoSQL databases can be faster than SQL databases. 
                                   (b) - But difficult delete or update operations.

        (e) - Caching mechanism
        (f) - NoSQL use case is more for Cloud applications.

5) - When to use NoSql?

        (a) - Fast-paced Agile development
        (b) - Storage of structured and semi-structured data.
        (c) - Huge volumes of Data
        (d) - Requirements for scale-out architecture.
        (e) - Modern application paradigms like micro-services and real-time streaming.
